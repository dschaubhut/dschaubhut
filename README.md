- 👋 Hi, I’m David Schaubhut
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software using the visual studio IDE. I know C# pretty well. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Arduinos for a project with robotics I'm a part of at work. Pretty fun so far, and C++ is a pretty easy language to learn. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. 
- 📫 You can reach me through my personal email: dschaubhutpersonal24@gmail.com.
