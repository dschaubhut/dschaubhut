- Hi, my name is David Schaubhut
- I’m interested in developing front end software using the visual studios IDE. I know C# pretty well. 
- I'm currently learning what it would take to become a front end developer.  
- I’m not collaborating on anything at the moment. 
- You can reach me through my personal email: dschaubhutpersonal24@gmail.com.
